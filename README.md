 I also browsed throught many stack overflow forums but did not include the links as I did not copy and paste any code into my script.
 If I am required to link every forum I read through I can do it for the next assignment, but due to the amount of forums I clicked through it would be impossible for me to remember which ones I was able to learn from and which ones were junk to me.
